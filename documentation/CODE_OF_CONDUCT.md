# Code of Conduct

## Our Commitment

We are committed to providing a welcoming and inclusive environment for all contributors, regardless of background, identity, or experience level. We pledge that participation in the TrinityChain community is a harassment-free experience for everyone.

## Our Standards

Examples of behavior that contributes to creating a positive environment include:

- Using welcoming and inclusive language
- Being respectful of differing opinions, viewpoints, and experiences
- Giving and gracefully accepting constructive feedback
- Focusing on what is best for the community
- Showing empathy towards other community members
- Asking questions and admitting when you don't know something

Examples of unacceptable behavior include:

- The use of sexualized language or imagery and unwelcome sexual attention or advances
- Trolling, insulting/derogatory comments, and personal or political attacks
- Public or private harassment
- Publishing others' private information, such as a physical or email address, without explicit permission
- Other conduct which could reasonably be considered inappropriate in a professional setting
- Discrimination based on race, color, religion, gender, gender identity and expression, age, national origin, or any other protected characteristic

## Enforcement

Community leaders are responsible for clarifying the standards of acceptable behavior and are expected to take appropriate and fair corrective action in response to any instances of unacceptable behavior.

Community leaders have the right and responsibility to remove, edit, or reject comments, commits, code, wiki edits, issues, and other contributions that are not aligned to this Code of Conduct, and will communicate reasons for moderation decisions when appropriate.

Instances of abusive, harassing, or otherwise unacceptable behavior may be reported by contacting the project maintainers at:

- Email: conduct@trinitychain.example (replace with actual contact)
